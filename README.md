## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```python
import numpy as np
from src.data.orderbook import MarketDataFeed
from src.features.feature_engine import FeatureEngine, FeatureConfig
from src.models.lstm_model import FastLSTM, LSTMTrainer
from src.models.transformer_model import FastTransformer, TransformerTrainer

# Create market data feed
feed = MarketDataFeed()
feed.add_symbol("AAPL")

# Setup feature engine
config = FeatureConfig(
    lookback_windows=[5, 10, 20, 50],
    price_features=True,
    volume_features=True,
    microstructure_features=True,
    significance_level=0.05
)
feature_engine = FeatureEngine(config)

# Update order book
feed.update_order_book("AAPL", "bid", 150.50, 1000, 5)
feed.update_order_book("AAPL", "ask", 150.51, 800, 3)

# Extract features
order_book = feed.get_order_book("AAPL")
price_history = np.array([150.48, 150.49, 150.50, 150.51, 150.50])
volume_history = np.array([1000, 1200, 800, 900, 1100])

features, validation = feature_engine.generate_features(
    order_book, price_history, volume_history
)
```

### Training Models

```python
# Train LSTM model
lstm_model = FastLSTM(input_size=20, hidden_size=64, num_layers=2)
lstm_trainer = LSTMTrainer(lstm_model)

# Prepare data
train_dataset, val_dataset, test_dataset = lstm_trainer.prepare_data(
    features, targets, sequence_length=20
)

# Train with latency monitoring
training_history = lstm_trainer.train(
    train_dataset, val_dataset,
    epochs=100,
    target_latency_ms=100.0
)

# Evaluate performance
metrics = lstm_trainer.evaluate(test_dataset)
print(f"Direction Accuracy: {metrics['direction_accuracy']:.3f}")
print(f"Average Latency: {metrics['avg_latency_ms']:.2f}ms")
```

### Real-time Prediction

```python
# Single prediction with latency measurement
sequence_features = np.random.randn(20, 10)  # 20 timesteps, 10 features
prediction, latency_ms = lstm_trainer.predict_single(sequence_features)

print(f"Predicted price change: {prediction:.6f}")
print(f"Prediction latency: {latency_ms:.2f}ms")
```
